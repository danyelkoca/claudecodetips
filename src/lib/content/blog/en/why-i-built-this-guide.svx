After using Claude Code every single day for 6 months, I realized I had accumulated a wealth of knowledge that most users never discover. This guide is my attempt to share that knowledge.

## The Beginning

When Claude Code first launched, I was skeptical. Another AI coding assistant? I'd tried many before, and they all fell short in various ways. But something about Claude Code was different.

Within the first week, I noticed patterns. Certain prompts worked better than others. Certain configurations made a huge difference. And certain workflows multiplied my productivity.

## What I Discovered

Over months of daily use, I discovered patterns that dramatically improved my productivity:

- **CLAUDE.md configuration** that actually works - not generic templates, but battle-tested instructions that shape Claude's behavior exactly how you want
- **Prompting techniques** that get consistent results - from "ultrathink" to strategic guidance
- **Workflow patterns** for complex, multi-file changes - using plan mode, git worktrees, and parallel agents
- **Safety practices** to avoid common pitfalls - protecting sensitive files, managing context, knowing when to start fresh

## Why a Paid Guide?

I could have written blog posts. But a comprehensive, organized guide serves you better. It's structured for learning, not for SEO. Every tip builds on the previous ones.

The $29 price reflects the value of 6 months of daily learning compressed into a structured guide.

## What's Inside

51 tips organized into 13 sections, covering everything from initial setup to advanced automation. This guide reflects the latest Claude Code features and best practices as of January 2026.

If you're serious about mastering Claude Code, this guide will save you months of trial and error.
