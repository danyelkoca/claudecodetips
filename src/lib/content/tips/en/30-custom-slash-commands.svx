Custom slash commands let you encode repeatable workflows as Markdown files. Instead of typing detailed instructions each time, invoke them with `/command_name`.

## Command Locations

Two storage options determine scope and visibility:

**Project Commands** - Shared with your team via git:
```bash
.claude/commands/review.md      # /project:review
.claude/commands/test/unit.md   # /project:test:unit
```

**Personal Commands** - Available across all projects:
```bash
~/.claude/commands/security.md  # /user:security
```

Project commands override personal commands with the same name.

## Basic Command Structure

Create a Markdown file. The filename (minus `.md`) becomes the command name:

```markdown
<!-- .claude/commands/review.md -->

Review this code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance issues
3. Edge cases
4. Code style violations

Provide specific suggestions with code examples.
```

Type `/project:review` to execute.

## Arguments with $ARGUMENTS

Pass dynamic values using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder:

```markdown
<!-- .claude/commands/fix-issue.md -->

Analyze and fix GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Use `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS` to get details
2. Search codebase for relevant files
3. Implement the fix
4. Write tests
5. Verify lint and type checks pass
```

Usage: `/project:fix-issue 1234` passes "1234" as the argument.

## Positional Arguments

Access individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc. (like bash):

```markdown
<!-- .claude/commands/pr-review.md -->
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request with priority and assignment
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2.
Assign findings to $3.
```

Usage: `/project:pr-review 456 high alice`

## Frontmatter Configuration

Optional YAML metadata controls behavior:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
argument-hint: [message]
description: Create a conventional commit
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `allowed-tools` | Restrict which tools the command can use |
| `argument-hint` | Shows expected args in autocomplete |
| `description` | Brief text shown in `/help` |
| `model` | Use specific model (haiku for speed, sonnet for reasoning) |

## Bash Command Execution

Prefix shell commands with `!` to execute before Claude processes the prompt:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git diff:*), Bash(git status:*)
description: Create commit from staged changes
---

## Current State

- Status: !`git status --short`
- Diff: !`git diff --staged`
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Task

Based on the above changes, create a commit following conventional commit format.
```

Claude sees the command output before reasoning - essential for context-aware commands.

## File References

Include file contents with `@` prefix:

```markdown
Compare the implementations in:
- @src/old-version.js
- @src/new-version.js

Identify breaking changes and migration steps.
```

## Practical Examples

### Git Workflow Automation

**Branch creation** (`.claude/commands/branch.md`):
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
argument-hint: [branch-description]
model: haiku
---

!`git status`
!`git branch --show-current`

Create a feature branch for: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Checkout main and pull latest
2. Create branch using kebab-case: feat/description
3. Push with upstream tracking
```

**Smart commit** (`.claude/commands/commit.md`):
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
model: haiku
---

!`git diff --staged`
!`git log --oneline -5`

Generate conventional commit message matching project style.
Add, commit, but don't push.
```

### Code Quality

**Lint and fix** (`.claude/commands/lint.md`):
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(npm:*), Read, Edit
model: haiku
---

Run linter with auto-fix. If errors remain, fix them manually.
Do NOT modify test files.
```

**Test runner** (`.claude/commands/test.md`):
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(npm:*), Read, Edit
---

!`npm test 2>&1 | head -100`

Fix any failing tests by updating the IMPLEMENTATION, not the test.
Tests define expected behavior.
```

### Security Audit

```markdown
<!-- ~/.claude/commands/security.md -->
---
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
description: Security vulnerability scan
---

Scan for:
- SQL injection risks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Exposed credentials or secrets
- Insecure dependencies
- Authentication bypasses

Report findings with severity, location, and remediation steps.
```

## Model Selection for Speed

Use Haiku for fast, simple operations:

```markdown
---
model: haiku
---
```

Haiku runs in ~20 seconds vs minutes for complex reasoning. Use for:
- Linting, formatting
- Simple git operations
- Test running
- Boilerplate generation

Reserve Sonnet/default for:
- Complex debugging
- Architecture decisions
- PR descriptions
- Security audits

## Organization Best Practices

Structure commands in subdirectories:

```
.claude/commands/
  git/
    branch.md     # /project:git:branch
    commit.md     # /project:git:commit
    pr.md         # /project:git:pr
  test/
    unit.md       # /project:test:unit
    e2e.md        # /project:test:e2e
  review/
    security.md   # /project:review:security
    perf.md       # /project:review:perf
```

## Team Benefits

Commands in `.claude/commands/` are version-controlled. When teammates clone, they get:
- Consistent workflows across the team
- Institutional knowledge encoded in prompts
- Reduced onboarding time
- Standardized code quality processes

## Shell Aliases for Power Users

Skip interactive mode entirely:

```bash
alias clint="claude -p '/project:lint'"
alias cpush="claude -p '/project:commit'"
alias cbranch="claude -p '/project:branch'"
```

## Skills vs Slash Commands

| Aspect | Slash Commands | Skills |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Trigger | Manual (`/command`) | Automatic (context-based) |
| Structure | Single .md file | Directory with SKILL.md |
| Use case | Repeatable workflows | Context-aware behaviors |

Use slash commands for explicit, repeatable tasks. Use skills when Claude should automatically apply certain behaviors based on context.

## MCP Integration

MCP servers expose prompts as slash commands:

```
/mcp__github__list_prs
/mcp__github__pr_review 456
```

Configure MCP servers with `claude mcp add` or in `.mcp.json`.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too generic**: Make commands specific. "Review this code" is weak. Include checklist items.
- **No context**: Use `!` bash commands to inject real-time state before reasoning.
- **Wrong model**: Don't use expensive models for simple tasks.
- **Missing tools**: Specify `allowed-tools` if your command needs bash or file access.
