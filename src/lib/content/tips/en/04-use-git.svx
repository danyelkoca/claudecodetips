Claude Code can modify dozens of files in seconds. Without version control, a single bad prompt can leave your codebase in an unrecoverable state. Git is not optional when working with AI coding assistants. It is your undo button, your safety net, and your debugging tool combined.

## Commit Before You Prompt

Always start Claude sessions with a clean git state. Before asking Claude to make any changes:

```bash
git status                    # Check current state
git add -A && git commit -m "Checkpoint before Claude session"
```

This creates a clear checkpoint. If Claude goes off the rails, you can instantly return to a known-good state. The biggest mistake developers make is letting uncommitted changes pile up, then asking Claude to modify the same files. When things break, you have no way to isolate which changes came from Claude versus your own work.

## Make Atomic Commits

An atomic commit represents one logical change. When working with Claude, this discipline becomes critical.

**Why atomic commits matter for AI-assisted development:**

- **Surgical rollbacks**: If Claude introduces a bug, you can revert just that change without losing unrelated work
- **Faster debugging**: Fewer commits to examine when hunting down issues
- **Better code reviews**: Reviewers see step-by-step logic, even if squashed later
- **AI-readable history**: Clean commits help Claude understand project evolution when analyzing your codebase

**Recommended cadence**: Commit after every significant Claude interaction. If Claude works for 30-60 minutes, that is likely multiple commits worth of changes.

```bash
# After Claude completes a task
git diff                      # Review what changed
git add -A
git commit -m "Add user search endpoint (Claude-assisted)"
```

## Review Every Change Before Committing

Never blindly commit Claude's output. Always review diffs:

```bash
git diff                      # Unstaged changes
git diff --staged             # Staged changes
git diff HEAD                 # Both staged and unstaged
```

**What to look for:**

- Unintended modifications to files you did not ask to change
- Debug statements or console.log left behind
- Credentials, API keys, or secrets accidentally added
- Scope creep beyond the requested change
- Removed code that should have been preserved

### Partial Staging for Granular Control

Use `git add -p` to stage specific chunks instead of entire files:

```bash
git add -p src/auth/login.js
```

Git presents each change and asks: `Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,s,e,?]?`

- `y` - stage this chunk
- `n` - skip this chunk
- `s` - split into smaller chunks
- `e` - manually edit the chunk

This lets you cherry-pick only the changes you approve and leave problematic ones unstaged for further review or discard.

## Mark AI Contributions in Commit Messages

Include AI involvement in your commit messages for transparency:

```bash
git commit -m "Refactor auth middleware for JWT support (Claude-assisted)"
git commit -m "Add pagination to user list API (AI-generated)"
```

This creates an audit trail. When debugging issues months later, you will know which commits warrant extra scrutiny. It also helps teammates understand code origin and apply appropriate review standards.

## Recovery Commands You Must Know

Claude will make mistakes. Know how to undo them.

### git reset - Undo Local Commits

```bash
# Undo last commit, keep changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit, keep changes unstaged (default)
git reset HEAD~1

# Undo last commit, DISCARD all changes (dangerous)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Use `--soft` when Claude's commit message was wrong but the code is fine. Use `--hard` when you want to completely discard Claude's work and start fresh.

### git revert - Safe Undo for Shared History

```bash
# Create a new commit that undoes a specific commit
git revert abc123

# Revert without auto-committing (review first)
git revert --no-commit abc123
```

Use `git revert` when the problematic commit has already been pushed. It preserves history while undoing the changes.

### git reflog - Your Emergency Recovery Tool

The reflog records every HEAD movement. Even after a hard reset, your commits are not truly gone:

```bash
git reflog                    # View recent HEAD history
git reset --hard HEAD@{3}     # Restore to state 3 moves ago
```

Reflog entries persist for 30-90 days. If you accidentally reset away Claude's good work, reflog can save you.

## Use Feature Branches

Isolate Claude's experimental work on dedicated branches:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/claude-auth-refactor
# ... work with Claude ...
git checkout main             # Return to stable code
```

**Benefits:**

- Discard entire experiments with `git branch -D feature/claude-experiment`
- Main branch stays stable while Claude experiments
- Easy to compare Claude's approach versus your own

**Naming conventions:**
- `feature/claude-user-search` - Claude-built features
- `experiment/claude-perf-optimization` - Exploratory work
- `fix/claude-login-bug` - Bug fixes

For parallel Claude sessions on different features, use git worktrees (see Tip 27).

## Git Stash for Quick Context Switches

When you need to pause Claude's work for an urgent fix:

```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: Claude auth refactor"
# ... handle urgent issue ...
git stash pop                 # Resume where you left off
```

Stash is local and temporary. For longer work-in-progress, prefer feature branches.

## Debugging with Git History

When Claude's changes introduce bugs, Git helps you find them.

### git blame - Find When Lines Changed

```bash
git blame src/api/users.js
```

Shows who changed each line and when. Useful for identifying exactly which Claude session introduced problematic code.

### git bisect - Binary Search for Bugs

When you know something worked before but not which commit broke it:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad                # Current commit is broken
git bisect good abc123        # This old commit worked
# Git checks out middle commit, you test it
git bisect good               # or git bisect bad
# Repeat until Git finds the exact breaking commit
git bisect reset              # Return to original state
```

With atomic commits, bisect quickly narrows down which Claude interaction caused the regression.

## Pre-Commit Hooks as Safety Net

Automate quality checks before every commit. The pre-commit framework catches issues Claude might introduce:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: check-added-large-files
      - id: detect-private-key
```

```bash
pre-commit install            # Set up hooks
```

Now every commit automatically checks for trailing whitespace, large files, and leaked secrets. See Tip 40 for more on hooks.

## Claude Code's Built-in Git Features

Claude Code can handle git operations through natural language:

```bash
# Auto-generate contextual commit messages
/commit

# Full workflow: commit, push, create PR
/commit-push-pr
```

You can also ask Claude directly:
- "Commit these changes with a descriptive message"
- "Create a PR for this feature"
- "Resolve the merge conflicts in package.json"
- "Revert the last commit"

Claude understands complex git operations like rebasing, cherry-picking, and conflict resolution.

## The Golden Rule

Never approve changes across multiple files without reviewing diffs first.

AI-generated code is not inherently safe. Studies show nearly half of AI code suggestions contain potential vulnerabilities. When Claude modifies a dozen files simultaneously and you approve without reviewing, any problems become impossible to diagnose later.

Git makes this manageable: small commits, frequent reviews, clear history. Without Git discipline, you are flying blind.
