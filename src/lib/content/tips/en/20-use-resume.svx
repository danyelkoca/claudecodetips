Terminal crashes happen. Laptop batteries die. SSH connections drop. Claude Code doesn't care. Every session is automatically saved, and you can pick up exactly where you left off.

## Resume Commands

The [CLI reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference) documents three ways to resume:

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `claude -c` or `claude --continue` | Quick access to your most recent session |
| `claude --resume` or `/resume` | Browse and select from past sessions |
| `claude --resume auth-refactor` | Jump to a specific named session |

The difference matters. `--continue` grabs your last session in the current directory. `--resume` without arguments opens a picker. `--resume <name>` skips the picker entirely.

## The Session Picker

Running `claude --resume` opens an [interactive picker](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows) with keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Up/Down` | Navigate between sessions |
| `Left/Right` | Expand/collapse grouped sessions |
| `Enter` | Resume selected session |
| `P` | Preview session content before resuming |
| `R` | Rename session |
| `/` | Search to filter sessions |
| `A` | Toggle between current directory and all projects |
| `B` | Filter by current git branch |
| `Esc` | Exit picker |

Each session shows its name, time since last activity, message count, and git branch. Press `P` to preview before committing.

## Name Your Sessions

Generic session names like "explain this function" are impossible to find later. Name sessions when you start meaningful work:

```bash
# Inside a session
/rename payment-integration
/rename bugfix-auth-timeout
/rename feature-dark-mode

# Resume by name later
claude --resume payment-integration
```

## What Gets Preserved

When you resume, Claude restores:

- **Full conversation history** - Every message, exactly as it happened
- **Tool usage and results** - All file reads, edits, bash commands
- **Context and memory** - What Claude learned about your project
- **Model configuration** - Same model and settings you were using

Sessions are stored locally in `~/.claude/projects/` organized by your working directory. The path gets encoded: `/home/user/project` becomes `-home-user-project`. This matters if you ever need to migrate sessions or debug storage issues.

## Crash Recovery Workflow

Terminal crashed mid-task? Here's the recovery workflow:

```bash
# 1. Reopen terminal, navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/my-app

# 2. Quick continue (most recent session)
claude -c

# 3. Or browse sessions if unsure which one
claude --resume
```

Claude resumes with full context. You can immediately ask "What were we working on?" and Claude remembers everything.

## Automation and Scripts

For CI/CD and scripting, use [print mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless) with resume:

```bash
# Capture session ID from a task
session_id=$(claude -p "Start code review" --output-format json | jq -r '.session_id')

# Continue that specific session later
claude -p "What issues did you find?" --resume "$session_id"

# Quick continue in non-interactive mode
claude -p "Continue the refactor" --continue
```

The `--output-format json` flag returns structured data including the session ID. Pipe it through `jq` to extract what you need. This is how you build multi-step workflows where Claude picks up context from previous runs.

## Session Forking with /rewind

The [`/rewind` command](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing) creates a fork from any previous point:

```bash
/rewind
# Opens a menu to select a checkpoint
# Choose: conversation only, code only, or both
```

You can also press `Esc` twice to trigger the rewind menu. Each rewind creates a new branch, so you can explore alternatives without losing your original work. Forked sessions appear grouped under their parent in the picker.

One thing to watch: frequent rewinding creates many forks. If your session picker gets cluttered, that's why. Name important branches with `/rename` so you can find them later.

## Session Cleanup

Sessions are automatically cleaned up after 30 days by default. To extend retention:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "cleanupPeriodDays": 99999
}
```

**Warning:** Setting `cleanupPeriodDays` to `0` wipes all stored sessions immediately. Don't do this unless you mean it.

## Session Storage Details

Sessions live in two places:
- `~/.claude/history.jsonl` - Index with session metadata
- `~/.claude/projects/[encoded-path]/` - Full conversation transcripts in JSONL format

Each project directory contains `.jsonl` files, one per session. These are newline-delimited JSON, so you can parse them with standard tools if you need to extract information or debug issues.

## Migrating Sessions to New Computer

After copying `~/.claude/` to a new machine, sessions may show "not found" errors because paths changed. The fix is straightforward:

```bash
# List your encoded project directories
ls ~/.claude/projects

# Copy sessions from old path to new path
cd ~/.claude/projects
cp -n ./-home-olduser-project/*.jsonl ./-home-newuser-project/
```

The `-n` flag prevents overwriting any sessions you've already created on the new machine. Common scenarios include:
- WSL to native Linux: `-home-ubuntu-*` to `-home-yourname-*`
- macOS username change: `-Users-oldname-*` to `-Users-newname-*`

Back up `~/.claude/` regularly. It contains your complete development conversation history, and there's no cloud backup.

## The Resume Workflow

Here's how I actually use resume in practice:

1. **Name sessions immediately** when starting meaningful work. "auth-refactor" beats "explain this function" every time.
2. **Use `--continue` for quick access.** It's muscle memory after your first terminal crash.
3. **Press `P` to preview** before resuming. Wrong session means wrong context, and Claude will give you answers based on the wrong project.
4. **Ask "What were we working on?"** after resuming long sessions. Claude's answer tells you if the context is still coherent or if you need to provide a summary.
5. **Don't resume stale sessions.** If it's been a week and the codebase changed significantly, start fresh. Old context is worse than no context.
