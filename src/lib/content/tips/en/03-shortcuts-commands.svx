These shortcuts live in muscle memory after a week. Print this page if you need to.

## Core Controls

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Esc` | Stop generation mid-response |
| `Esc` + `Esc` | Open [rewind menu](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode) to restore previous states |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current input |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit session |
| `?` | Show all shortcuts for your environment |

Double-tap `Esc` on an empty prompt to rewind the conversation. Note: this resets messages only. File changes stay on disk. Pair with git or ask Claude to undo explicitly.

## Screen & History

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear terminal screen (conversation persists) |
| `Ctrl+R` | Reverse search through prompt history |
| `Up/Down` | Navigate previous inputs |
| `Ctrl+O` | [Toggle verbose output](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode) (shows tool usage details) |
| `Ctrl+G` | Open prompt in your system's text editor |

`Ctrl+O` is gold for debugging. When Claude goes quiet mid-task, toggle verbose to see what it's actually doing.

## Mode & Model Switching

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle: Normal -> Auto-Accept -> Plan Mode |
| `Alt+M` | Same as Shift+Tab (alternative binding) |
| `Option+P` (Mac) / `Alt+P` | Switch model while typing |
| `Tab` | Toggle extended thinking (may require `/config` on some versions) |

When you're mid-prompt and realize this needs Opus 4.5 instead of Sonnet 4.5, hit `Option+P` to switch without retyping.

## Input Methods

### Images

`Ctrl+V` pastes images from clipboard. On Mac, this is `Ctrl+V`, not `Cmd+V`. On Windows, use `Alt+V`. Linux support varies by terminal.

### Multiline Input

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Universal | `\` then `Enter` |
| macOS | `Option+Enter` |
| After setup | `Shift+Enter` (run `/terminal-setup` first) |
| Control sequence | `Ctrl+J` (line feed) |

The `/terminal-setup` command configures Shift+Enter for [iTerm2, VS Code, Kitty, Alacritty, Zed, and Warp](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode). Other terminals need manual configuration.

## Quick Prefixes

| Prefix | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `/` | Slash command (built-in or custom) |
| `#` | Add instruction directly to CLAUDE.md |
| `!` | Execute bash command without Claude interpreting it |
| `@` | File path autocomplete |

The `!` prefix runs commands raw. `! npm test` adds the command and output to context without Claude trying to "help."

## Background Execution

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+B` | Push running bash command to background |
| `/bashes` | List and manage background tasks |

Tmux users: press `Ctrl+B` twice since tmux intercepts the first one.

Background commands are assigned IDs like `bash_1`, `bash_2`. Claude can keep working while your dev server runs.

## Slash Commands

### Session Management

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/help` | List available commands |
| `/status` | Version, model, account info |
| `/config` | Open settings (thinking toggle, model, permissions) |
| `/exit` | Exit the REPL |
| `/clear` | Wipe conversation (CLAUDE.md persists) |
| `/rename <name>` | Name current session |
| `/resume [name]` | Resume session by name or ID |

### Context Control

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/context` | Token usage as [colored grid](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands) (red = trouble) |
| `/compact [focus]` | Compress conversation with optional focus area |
| `/rewind` | Restore to previous checkpoint |
| `/export [file]` | Export conversation to file or clipboard |

`/compact focus on the authentication changes` preserves what matters while dropping the noise.

### Code Quality

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/init` | Create CLAUDE.md for this project |
| `/memory` | Edit CLAUDE.md files |
| `/review` | Request code review |
| `/security-review` | [Security audit](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11932705-automated-security-reviews-in-claude-code) of pending changes |
| `/doctor` | Check installation health |
| `/add-dir` | Add working directories |
| `/todos` | List tracked TODO items |

The `/security-review` command catches SQL injection, XSS, and auth flaws before you commit. Ten keystrokes, real vulnerabilities found.

### Model & Permissions

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/model` | Select model |
| `/permissions` | View/update tool permissions (use `/` to search) |
| `/sandbox` | Enable sandboxed bash with filesystem isolation |

### Integrations

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/mcp` | Manage [MCP server connections](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) |
| `/ide` | Manage IDE integrations (VS Code, JetBrains) |
| `/plugin` | Install and manage plugins |
| `/hooks` | Configure tool event hooks |
| `/agents` | Manage custom subagents |
| `/install-github-app` | Set up Claude for PR reviews |
| `/pr-comments` | View PR comments |

### Account & Stats

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/stats` | Usage graph, streaks, model preferences |
| `/usage` | Plan limits and rate limit status |
| `/cost` | Token usage breakdown |
| `/login` | Switch accounts |
| `/logout` | Sign out |
| `/bug` | Report issues to Anthropic |
| `/privacy-settings` | Manage privacy preferences |
| `/release-notes` | What's new |

### Display

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/theme` | Open theme picker |
| `/statusline` | Configure status line display |
| `/output-style` | Set output formatting |
| `/vim` | Enable vim-style editing |
| `/terminal-setup` | Configure Shift+Enter for your terminal |

Vim mode gives you `h/j/k/l` navigation, `dd` to delete lines, `i/a/o` to insert. Run `/config` to make it permanent.

## Custom Commands

Create workflows as markdown files:

- Project: `.claude/commands/*.md`
- Personal: `~/.claude/commands/*.md`

Execute with `/project:command-name` or `/user:command-name`.

Files in subdirectories get namespaced: `.claude/frontend/component.md` becomes `/frontend:component`.

Commands support `$ARGUMENTS` for all args, or `$1`, `$2` for positional parameters.
