Claude is multimodal. Visual input is one of the most underutilized features in Claude Code. Stop describing bugs in text when you can show them. A screenshot conveys in seconds what takes paragraphs to describe.

## Three Ways to Add Images

### 1. Clipboard Paste

Copy an image to your clipboard, then paste. The keyboard shortcut varies by platform:

| Platform | Shortcut |
|----------|----------|
| macOS | `Ctrl+V` (not Cmd+V) |
| Windows | `Alt+V` (as of v1.0.93) |
| Linux | Often unsupported, use alternatives below |

The macOS shortcut trips up everyone. Muscle memory says Cmd+V, but Claude Code uses Ctrl+V for image paste.

**Fastest macOS workflow:**

```bash
# Screenshot to clipboard (no file saved)
Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4

# Then in Claude Code
Ctrl+V
```

You'll see `[Image]` appear in your prompt, confirming the paste worked.

### 2. Drag and Drop

Drag image files directly into the Claude Code terminal. Hold `Shift` while dragging to ensure Claude references the file in your prompt rather than just opening it.

This is the most reliable method across all platforms. When clipboard paste fails, drag and drop usually works.

### 3. File Path Reference

Reference any image on your filesystem:

```
Analyze this screenshot: /Users/me/Desktop/bug.png
```

Claude reads and analyzes the image at that path. This is the only option that works reliably on remote servers via SSH.

## Formats and Limits

According to [Anthropic's vision documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision), Claude accepts four image formats:

| Format | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| PNG | Screenshots, UI, text | Crisp rendering, supports transparency |
| JPEG | Photographs | Good compression |
| GIF | Simple graphics | Only first frame analyzed |
| WebP | Modern alternative | Best compression |

**Size Limits:**

| Context | Max File Size | Max Resolution | Max Images |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| API | 5MB per image | 8000x8000 px | 100 per request |
| claude.ai | 30MB per image | 8000x8000 px | 20 per turn |

**Resolution Behavior:**
- Images over 1568 pixels on the long edge get auto-downscaled
- [Anthropic recommends](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) resizing to 1.15 megapixels or less for best time-to-first-token
- Images under 200 pixels may produce inaccurate analysis

## Token Cost

Images consume tokens. The formula from [Anthropic's docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision):

```
tokens = (width * height) / 750
```

| Image Size | Tokens | Cost per 1K images (Sonnet 4.5) |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| 200x200 px | ~54 | ~$0.16 |
| 1000x1000 px | ~1,334 | ~$4.00 |
| 1092x1092 px | ~1,590 | ~$4.80 |

Crop to the relevant area before sending. A full-screen screenshot costs more than a cropped section showing just the problem.

## Visual Bug Debugging

See a visual bug? Screenshot and paste.

```
[paste screenshot of misaligned button]

Fix this button alignment.
```

Claude identifies the CSS problem, locates the code, and suggests fixes. This takes 30 seconds versus 5 minutes explaining "the button on the right side of the header is 3 pixels too low."

**What works well:**
- Layout issues (flexbox, grid, spacing)
- Color and styling problems
- Responsive breakpoint bugs
- Z-index and overlap issues

## Design-to-Code

Screenshot a Figma mockup, Dribbble design, or any UI reference:

```
[paste design mockup]

Implement this card component in React + Tailwind.
Match spacing and typography.
```

**Iterative refinement:**

1. Provide the design mockup
2. Claude implements the component
3. Screenshot Claude's rendered output
4. Paste both images: "Compare these. Fix the differences."
5. Repeat until accurate

Two or three iterations usually gets you there. First pass is rarely pixel-perfect.

If you're doing heavy design-to-code work, consider connecting [Figma's MCP server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/35281350665623-Figma-MCP-collection-How-to-set-up-the-Figma-remote-MCP-server). It extracts design tokens, component specs, and exact values directly from your Figma files:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp
```

See Tip 41 for more on MCP servers.

## Architecture Diagrams

Feed Claude your architecture diagrams, flowcharts, or system documentation:

```
[paste architecture diagram]

Generate TypeScript interfaces for this microservices architecture.
```

Claude handles:
- Flowcharts and process diagrams
- Database schema diagrams
- Whiteboard sketches and hand-drawn diagrams
- UML and sequence diagrams
- API documentation screenshots

The output quality depends on image clarity. Clean diagrams with readable text work best.

## Platform Quirks

### macOS
Full clipboard support. Use `Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4` for screenshot-to-clipboard, then `Ctrl+V` to paste. Remember: Control, not Command.

### Windows Native
Use `Alt+V` to paste from clipboard. This was added in Claude Code v1.0.93. Drag and drop also works.

### Linux
Clipboard paste is [unreliable across terminal emulators](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/834). Workarounds:
- Drag and drop image files
- Save screenshots to a known location and reference by path
- Kitty terminal users can configure custom clipboard handling

### WSL
The clipboard lives on your Windows host, not in WSL. Claude Code running in WSL can't access it. Options:
- Use a [VS Code extension](https://github.com/aggroot/claude-image-paste) that bridges Windows clipboard to WSL
- Save screenshots to a WSL-accessible path
- Drag files from Windows Explorer into WSL terminal

### Remote/SSH
Clipboard paste doesn't work over SSH. The clipboard is on your local machine. Transfer images to the server and use file path references.

## Limitations

[Anthropic's documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) lists these vision limitations:

- **People identification**: Claude refuses to name individuals in photos. This is policy, not a bug.
- **Spatial reasoning**: Struggles with precise localization, like reading analog clocks or exact positions of chess pieces.
- **Counting**: Approximate counts work, but don't expect precision with many small objects.
- **AI-generated detection**: Claude can't reliably detect if an image is AI-generated.
- **Medical imaging**: Not designed for diagnostic interpretation of CT/MRI scans.
- **Quality sensitivity**: Blurry, rotated, or low-resolution images increase errors.

## Best Practices

1. **Crop aggressively.** Show the problem, not the entire screen.
2. **Match format to content.** PNG for UI and text. JPEG for photos.
3. **Image before text.** Claude processes image-then-text more effectively.
4. **Add context.** "This button should be blue" helps more than the screenshot alone.
5. **Expect iteration.** First attempt is rarely perfect. Two or three rounds is normal.
6. **Watch token costs.** Large images add up. Resize when quality permits.

## Workflow Example

A CSS layout breaking on mobile:

1. Open DevTools, switch to mobile viewport
2. `Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4` to screenshot the broken layout
3. `Ctrl+V` in Claude Code
4. "The card grid should be single column on mobile. Fix this."

Claude sees what you see, identifies the missing media query, and provides the fix. Done in 30 seconds.
