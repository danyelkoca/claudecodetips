Skills are folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude discovers and loads automatically when relevant to your task. Unlike slash commands (you type `/command`) or CLAUDE.md (always loaded), Skills activate only when Claude determines they match what you're doing.

## Why Skills Matter

Skills solve the context efficiency problem. Your CLAUDE.md loads every conversation. MCP servers consume tokens just by being connected. But Skills use progressive disclosure - Claude only sees the name and description at startup (~100 tokens per Skill), then loads full content only when needed.

Think of Skills as modular chunks of expertise. Instead of stuffing everything into CLAUDE.md, you package specialized knowledge into Skills that Claude accesses on-demand.

## How Skills Work

**Step 1: Discovery**
At startup, Claude scans available Skills and loads only their frontmatter (name + description). This is cheap - dozens of tokens per Skill.

**Step 2: Matching**
When you make a request, Claude reads the Skill descriptions and uses language understanding to match your intent. No regex, no keyword matching - pure reasoning.

**Step 3: Activation**
When Claude finds a match, it asks permission to load the Skill. You see a confirmation prompt before the full `SKILL.md` enters context.

**Step 4: Execution**
Claude follows the Skill's instructions, loading referenced files or running bundled scripts as needed.

## Directory Structure

Skills live in specific locations:

```
~/.claude/skills/          # Personal - available in all projects
.claude/skills/            # Project - shared with team via git
```

Each Skill is a folder containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required - core instructions
├── reference.md          # Optional - detailed docs
├── examples.md           # Optional - usage examples
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py         # Optional - utility scripts
```

## SKILL.md Format

Every Skill needs YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`, followed by markdown instructions:

```yaml
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code for security, performance, and best practices. Use when reviewing code changes or PRs.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Code Review

## Instructions
1. Read all changed files completely
2. Check for security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
3. Identify performance issues
4. Flag edge cases and error handling gaps

## Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] Error messages don't leak internals
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase, numbers, hyphens only. Max 64 chars. |
| `description` | Yes | What it does + when to use. Max 1024 chars. Claude uses this for matching. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Tools Claude can use without permission (e.g., `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash(python:*)`) |
| `model` | No | Override model for this Skill (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |

## Writing Effective Descriptions

The description is critical - it's how Claude decides whether to activate your Skill.

**Bad:**
```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```

**Good:**
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

Include:
1. **What it does**: Specific capabilities
2. **Trigger words**: Keywords users would naturally say

## Progressive Disclosure

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. For larger Skills, split content:

```markdown
## Quick start
[Essential instructions here - always loaded]

## Detailed reference
See [reference.md](reference.md) for complete API docs.

## Examples
See [examples.md](examples.md) for common patterns.
```

Claude only reads referenced files when needed. This keeps token usage minimal.

**Key rule:** Keep references one level deep. Don't chain links (A references B references C). Claude may partially read nested files.

## Bundling Scripts

Skills can include executable code that runs without loading into context:

```
pdf-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    ├── extract_text.py
    ├── fill_form.py
    └── validate.py
```

In your SKILL.md:

```markdown
## Extract text
Run: `python scripts/extract_text.py input.pdf > output.txt`

## Fill form
Run: `python scripts/fill_form.py template.pdf data.json output.pdf`
```

Scripts execute via Bash. Only the output enters context - the script code itself stays on disk.

## Skills vs. Alternatives

| Feature | Skills | Slash Commands | CLAUDE.md | Subagents |
|---------|--------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Activation | Auto (Claude chooses) | Manual (`/command`) | Always loaded | Claude delegates |
| Supporting files | Yes | No | No | N/A |
| Separate context | No | No | No | Yes |
| Best for | Specialized expertise | Repeatable prompts | Project rules | Heavy tasks |

**Use Skills when:**
- You want Claude to auto-apply expertise based on context
- You have multi-file workflows with scripts/references
- The capability is domain-specific (PDF processing, code review, data analysis)

**Use Slash Commands when:**
- You want explicit, predictable invocation
- The workflow is simple (single markdown file)
- You need argument passing (`/review $FILE`)

## Tool Restrictions

Limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active:

```yaml
---
name: safe-reader
description: Read-only file exploration. Use when browsing code without modifications.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

This prevents accidental writes during exploratory Skills.

## Practical Examples

### Commit Message Generator

```yaml
---
name: commit-messages
description: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commits or reviewing staged changes.
---

## Process
1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
2. Generate commit message with:
   - Summary under 50 characters (imperative mood)
   - Blank line
   - Detailed body explaining what and why

## Format
- feat: new features
- fix: bug fixes
- refactor: code changes without behavior change
- docs: documentation only
- test: adding tests
```

### API Documentation Skill

```yaml
---
name: api-docs
description: Generates API documentation from code. Use when documenting endpoints, functions, or modules.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

## Instructions
1. Read the source file completely
2. Extract function signatures, parameters, return types
3. Generate markdown documentation with:
   - Description
   - Parameters table
   - Return value
   - Example usage
   - Error cases

For OpenAPI specs, see [openapi-template.md](openapi-template.md).
```

## Installing Community Skills

Anthropic maintains official Skills at `github.com/anthropics/skills`:
- `pdf` - Extract, fill forms, merge PDFs
- `docx` - Create/edit Word documents
- `xlsx` - Spreadsheet manipulation
- `pptx` - Presentation creation

Install via plugin system:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

Then just mention the capability: "Extract form fields from invoice.pdf" - Claude loads the Skill automatically.

## Debugging Skills

**Skill not triggering?**
- Description too vague. Add specific trigger words.
- Check file path: must be `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive on some systems).

**Skill not loading?**
- Verify YAML syntax (no tabs, `---` on line 1).
- Run `claude --debug` to see Skill discovery logs.

**Multiple Skills conflicting?**
- Make descriptions more distinct with specific trigger terms.
- Claude chooses based on best semantic match.

## Skills with Subagents

Custom subagents can use Skills. In your `.claude/agents/AGENT.md`:

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and security
skills: code-review, security-check
---
```

**Note:** Built-in agents (Explore, Plan, Verify) and the Task tool cannot use Skills. Only custom subagents with explicit `skills` field.

## Best Practices

1. **Write in third person.** Descriptions inject into system prompt. "Processes PDFs" not "I can process PDFs."

2. **Test with all models.** What works for Opus may need more detail for Haiku.

3. **Assume Claude is smart.** Don't over-explain. Only add context Claude doesn't already have.

4. **Include feedback loops.** For complex tasks, add validation steps: run, validate, fix, repeat.

5. **Use scripts for deterministic work.** PDF parsing, data transformation, file manipulation - code is more reliable than generation.

6. **Version your Skills.** Commit `.claude/skills/` to git. They evolve with your project.
