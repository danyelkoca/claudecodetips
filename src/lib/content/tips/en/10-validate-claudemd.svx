summary: "Ask Claude to validate its plan against CLAUDE.md rules. Claude forgets instructions as conversations grow - force explicit verification."
isFree: false
---

Claude often forgets its own instructions. As conversations grow longer, rules defined at the start receive progressively less attention. Research shows instruction compliance drops from 95% initially to below 60% by message 6-10. This is not a bug - it is how transformer attention mechanisms work. Your critical CLAUDE.md rules are competing with recent context for attention weight.

The solution is explicit validation. Before Claude executes a plan, ask it to verify the plan against your CLAUDE.md rules. This forces Claude to re-read and re-process your instructions at the moment they matter most.

## The Instruction Decay Problem

Large language models do not actually "remember" conversations. They read the entire history as one long document every time they respond. Your instructions, sitting at the beginning of this document, gradually lose importance as the conversation grows.

Making matters worse, Claude Code injects a system reminder stating that CLAUDE.md content "may or may not be relevant to your tasks." This causes Claude to de-prioritize instructions it deems non-essential. The more task-specific or narrow your rules appear, the higher the chance Claude ignores them for generic tasks.

**Observable symptoms of instruction decay:**

- Claude stops following code style rules you defined earlier
- Architectural patterns get violated despite explicit documentation
- Testing requirements get skipped in later implementation phases
- File naming conventions drift from project standards
- Import patterns become inconsistent across files

## The Validation Workflow

Before approving any plan for execution, insert a validation checkpoint:

**Step 1: Claude presents a plan**

After analysis in plan mode, Claude proposes an implementation approach.

**Step 2: Request explicit validation**

```bash
> Before you proceed, validate this plan against CLAUDE.md. Check each rule. Does this plan follow all the rules? List any violations.
```

**Step 3: Review Claude's validation response**

Claude re-reads CLAUDE.md and audits the plan against each rule. It will either confirm compliance or identify gaps.

**Step 4: Iterate or approve**

If violations exist, ask Claude to revise the plan. If compliant, approve execution.

## Validation Prompts That Work

Use these prompts at key checkpoints:

**Pre-implementation validation:**

```bash
> Validate this plan against CLAUDE.md. Does it follow all the rules? List each rule and whether this plan complies.
```

**Post-implementation validation:**

```bash
> Check the changes you just made against CLAUDE.md rules. Identify any deviations. Say PASS or FAIL.
```

**Completion analysis (PDCA framework):**

```bash
> Before we close this task, verify: All tests passing? Documentation accurate? Code coverage adequate? TDD discipline maintained? No TODO implementations remaining? Ready to close: Yes or No with reasoning.
```

**Constraint verification:**

```bash
> Before implementing, verify this approach against these constraints: [list from CLAUDE.md]. Confirm each one is satisfied.
```

## What to Validate Against

Structure your CLAUDE.md with a Final Checklist section. This gives Claude a concrete list to validate against:

```markdown
## Final Checklist

Before delivering a solution, confirm:

- [ ] Read all relevant files before modifying
- [ ] No new utilities if similar ones exist
- [ ] Clean code - no unused imports, dead code, orphaned comments
- [ ] No unnecessary fallbacks or error handling
- [ ] Follows existing patterns in the codebase
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] No hard-coded strings (i18n applied)
- [ ] Visual styling matches existing pages
```

When you ask Claude to validate, it walks through this checklist item by item. The checkbox format makes violations obvious.

## Advanced Validation Techniques

### Recursive Rule Display

Force Claude to display your rules at the start of every response. This creates multiple attention anchors throughout the conversation:

```markdown
## Behavioral Rules

<rules>
1. Always confirm before creating or modifying files
2. Report your plan before executing commands
3. Follow all patterns documented in CLAUDE.md
4. Display these rules at the start of every response
</rules>
```

The self-referential rule (item 4) ensures the rules persist in recent context. Research shows XML tags are most reliable for rule preservation compared to markdown, JSON, or YAML.

### The Reflection Pattern

Apply self-critique before finalization:

```bash
> Review your proposed solution. What could go wrong? What edge cases exist? Does this truly follow all CLAUDE.md rules, or did you make compromises? Be critical.
```

This triggers Claude's reflection capabilities - a second pass where it evaluates its own output for accuracy and quality. Studies show self-reflection significantly improves output quality, though at the cost of additional tokens.

### Periodic Reminder System

For long sessions, insert reminders every few messages:

```bash
> Reminder: Re-read CLAUDE.md rules before your next response. What are the key constraints for this project?
```

This counteracts instruction decay by periodically refreshing Claude's attention on your rules.

## When to Validate

**Always validate:**

- Before exiting plan mode
- After completing multi-file changes
- Before committing code
- When switching between major tasks
- After extended conversation (10+ messages)

**Skip validation for:**

- Single-line fixes with obvious correctness
- Trivial changes that do not touch architecture
- Repeated patterns Claude has already validated

## Combining with Plan Mode and Extended Thinking

Maximum effectiveness comes from combining validation with plan mode:

```bash
# Enter plan mode with Shift+Tab twice
> ultrathink. Create a plan for implementing user authentication. After planning, validate the plan against CLAUDE.md before we proceed.
```

This allocates maximum thinking budget to both planning and validation. Claude researches thoroughly, formulates a plan, then audits it against your rules - all before any files change.

## Common Validation Failures

**Shallow validation**: Claude says "plan follows all rules" without actually checking each one. Fix by asking for explicit per-rule confirmation.

**Selective validation**: Claude validates against rules it remembers, ignoring ones that drifted from context. Fix by asking Claude to re-read CLAUDE.md first.

**Optimistic interpretation**: Claude interprets rules loosely to claim compliance. Fix by asking for specific evidence: "Show me which existing pattern you are following."

**Validation theater**: Claude performs validation steps but proceeds despite violations. Fix by requiring explicit PASS/FAIL and blocking execution on FAIL.

## Making Validation Automatic

Add validation requirements to your CLAUDE.md itself:

```markdown
## Mandatory Validation

Before implementing any plan:
1. Re-read this entire CLAUDE.md file
2. List each rule that applies to the current task
3. Confirm the plan satisfies each rule
4. If any rule is violated, revise the plan before proceeding
```

This makes validation part of Claude's standard workflow rather than something you must remember to request.

## The Bottom Line

Claude is a powerful collaborator but not a perfect rule-follower. Instruction decay is real and measurable. The antidote is explicit validation checkpoints where you force Claude to re-engage with your rules at the moments that matter.

Every minute spent on validation saves ten minutes fixing rule violations. Every plan validated against CLAUDE.md reduces the chance of architectural drift, style inconsistencies, and integration failures.

Do not trust "I followed all the rules." Verify it. Ask Claude to prove compliance. Make validation a habit, and your CLAUDE.md transforms from a document Claude might read into a contract Claude must honor.
