"It's giving some kind of null error" tells Claude nothing. The file path, line number, function name, and call chain you just stripped away? That's exactly what it needs to pinpoint the problem in seconds.

[Microsoft Research found](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/debug-gym-an-environment-for-ai-coding-tools-to-learn-how-to-debug-code-like-programmers/) that AI coding tools "don't seek additional information when solutions fail," leaving many bugs unaddressed. When you paraphrase, you're removing the only information Claude has to work with.

## What an Error Message Actually Contains

Every complete error has multiple parts. Each one matters.

**Exception type**: NullPointerException, TypeError, ENOENT. This tells Claude what category of failure occurred. "It crashed" could mean ten thousand things. "TypeError" narrows it to a handful.

**Error message**: The description ("Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"). This explains the symptom, not the cause. Claude needs both.

**Stack trace**: The sequence of function calls leading to the failure. Each frame contains a file path, line number, function name, and sometimes column position. This is the most valuable part, and it's the first thing people cut.

**Cause chain**: For nested exceptions, the original error at the bottom of the stack is usually the root cause. Everything above it is a consequence.

Here's the difference:

```
"It crashed" → Claude guesses at 10 possible causes

"TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
 at UserList.render (components/UserList.js:47:23)" → Claude opens line 47
```

## What Gets Lost When You Summarize

**Line numbers.** "Something's wrong in the user component" vs "UserList.js:47". One takes 30 seconds. The other takes 30 minutes of scanning 500 lines.

**The call chain.** A bug in function A might only manifest when called from function B via function C. Without the trace, Claude can't see how the program got there.

**Error codes.** E11000 (MongoDB duplicate key), ECONNREFUSED (connection failed), 0x80070005 (Windows access denied). These codes are searchable. Stack Overflow answers match them exactly. Your paraphrase loses the searchability.

**Environment details.** OS paths, package versions, configuration values. Many errors only happen in specific environments. The error message often reveals which one.

## The Context Problem

[Sentry's AI debugging agent achieves 94% accuracy](https://blog.sentry.io/want-ai-to-be-better-at-debugging-its-all-about-context/) in root cause identification. Why? It has access to complete error events: stack traces, environment info, logs, breadcrumbs, commit history, and source code.

When you paste a summary, you're giving Claude a fraction of that. And the problem compounds. As you add clarifications and partial fixes, the context window fills with incomplete information. Each back-and-forth where Claude has to guess increases the chance of a wrong fix.

In longer conversations, I've found Claude starts making assumptions about the error based on earlier (now outdated) context. Paste the full error fresh each time.

## Bad vs Good

**Bad:**

```
User: the login page doesn't work

Claude: [Guesses at ten possible causes, none correct]
```

**Also bad:**

```
User: I'm getting some kind of authentication error

Claude: [Generic auth troubleshooting that doesn't apply]
```

**Good:**

```
User: Getting this error on login:

Error: TokenExpiredError: jwt expired
    at /app/middleware/auth.js:23:15
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:95:5)
    at async authMiddleware (/app/middleware/auth.js:18:5)
    at async /app/routes/user.js:45:3

Claude: [Opens auth.js:23, identifies the JWT expiration check, suggests specific fix]
```

## What to Include

When sharing an error with Claude, include:

**1. The complete error output.** Everything. The stack trace, the error message, any warnings that preceded it. Use triple backticks to preserve formatting.

**2. The command that triggered it.** What exactly did you run? `npm run build`, `python main.py --config prod.yaml`, the curl command, the test command.

**3. Recent changes.** "This started after I added user authentication" narrows the investigation scope dramatically. Temporal context is underrated.

**4. Environment details when relevant.** Node version, Python version, OS, package versions. Many errors are version-specific.

## Pipe Errors Directly

Claude Code accepts piped input. Instead of copying manually:

```bash
npm run build 2>&1 | claude -p "explain this error and suggest a fix"
```

For log files:

```bash
cat error.log | claude -p "find the root cause of the failures in this log"
```

The `-p` flag runs Claude in print mode, which processes the input and exits. According to [Anthropic's CLI documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), piping is "particularly useful for logs, CSVs, and large data."

For large log files, you can combine this with a follow-up prompt:

```bash
cat server.log | claude -p "find the root cause of the 502 errors"
```

## The Two-Step Debugging Approach

Don't ask Claude to simultaneously understand and fix the problem. That's where debugging goes wrong. A [better pattern](https://gigamind.dev/blog/prompt-method-debugging-ai-code) separates analysis from action.

**Step 1: Analyze**

```
Here's the error I'm seeing:
[paste full error]

Before suggesting any fixes, explain:
1. What this error means
2. What conditions cause it
3. Where in my code it likely originates
```

**Step 2: Fix**

```
Based on your analysis, what's the most likely fix? Show me the specific code change.
```

This gives you a checkpoint. You can verify Claude's understanding before it starts changing code. I've caught misdiagnoses this way that would have led to hours of wasted work.

## Error Types Where Verbatim Matters Most

**Async/Promise errors.** Stack traces in async code can be misleading. The full trace shows whether the error came from the promise chain, an await, or a callback. Summaries lose this.

**Build tool errors.** Webpack, Vite, and bundler errors often have multiple stack traces: the tool's internal trace and your code's trace. Both matter. I've seen people paste only the "user-facing" error and miss the actual cause buried in the tool trace.

**Type errors.** "Type error somewhere" vs "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'User[]' at src/api/users.ts:34". TypeScript errors contain the exact mismatch. That's the whole diagnosis.

**Database errors.** Connection strings, query syntax, constraint names. Database errors pack everything into a single message. Lose any part and you're debugging blind.

**API errors.** HTTP status codes, response bodies, request IDs. All needed to debug API failures. A 500 error without the response body is almost useless.

## Add This to Your CLAUDE.md

```markdown
## Error Reporting Requirements

When encountering errors:
- Always paste the complete error message and stack trace
- Include the exact command or action that triggered the error
- Mention any recent changes that might be related
- Note the environment (OS, language version, package versions)
- Do not summarize or paraphrase error messages
```

## The Cost of Paraphrasing

When you paraphrase:

- Claude guesses at the error type
- Searchable error codes disappear
- Stack trace context is gone
- Multiple exchanges waste tokens and time
- The fix may address a different error

When you copy verbatim:

- Claude sees exactly what you see
- Line numbers point to specific code
- Error codes match documentation
- First-response accuracy jumps

I've tracked this informally over months. Verbatim errors get fixed in one or two exchanges. Paraphrased ones take four or five, if they get fixed at all.

## The Bottom Line

Error messages are precise for a reason. They contain exactly the information needed to diagnose the problem.

Select everything from the error type to the last line of the stack trace. Copy it. Paste it into Claude exactly as it appears. Don't summarize. Don't paraphrase. Don't "clean it up."

The verbatim error contains the solution. Your summary hides it.
