Ambiguous requirement? Claude picks an interpretation and runs with it. Wrong guess = wasted work. This is one of the most expensive pitfalls in AI-assisted development.

## The Cost of Wrong Assumptions

When Claude assumes instead of asking, consequences compound:

- Hours lost implementing features that don't match your intent
- Architectural decisions that become difficult to change
- Refactoring that touches files you never intended to modify
- Context gaps that propagate through subsequent changes

Research shows that structural tasks like refactoring suffer most from AI missing context. The more a task depends on understanding the broader codebase or your specific requirements, the more likely Claude is to miss the mark.

## Why Claude Assumes Instead of Asks

This behavior is baked into how language models are trained:

**RLHF Bias**: During Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, responses are judged in isolation. An answer that "looks complete" often beats a question asking for clarification. Human labelers preferred confident answers over incomplete responses, so models learned to answer ambiguous queries by guessing an interpretation.

**Lack of Training Examples**: There are very few dialogue examples in training data where the assistant says, "I'm not sure what you mean, could you clarify?" The model might know a question is ambiguous but still doesn't behave accordingly because it was never taught that clarifying is the correct action.

**User Experience Concerns**: By design, many assistants avoid asking too many questions, fearing it might annoy users or make the AI seem less capable. This results in overconfident answers to underspecified questions.

**Prediction Objective**: The fundamental training task (predict the next token) never included an option to abstain. Models are implicitly taught that giving some answer is better than giving no answer.

## How This Differs from Being a YES MAN

This is the OPPOSITE of tip 36 (Claude is a YES MAN):

- **YES MAN** is reactive: Claude validates YOUR bad ideas when you suggest them
- **Assumes** is proactive: Claude invents things you DIDN'T ask for

YES MAN follows your lead uncritically. Assumes runs ahead without asking for direction. Both are problems, but they require different solutions.

## The AskUserQuestion Tool

Recent Claude Code versions added the AskUserQuestion tool (v2.0.21+). This is a structured way for Claude to pause execution and ask clarifying questions.

Instead of guessing, Claude can now say: "I see three ways to fix this API. Do you prefer A, B, or C?" This represents a deliberate architectural decision by Anthropic. Rather than relying on system prompt instructions alone, they created a dedicated tool because structured questioning produces better outcomes than free-form prompting.

The tool allows Claude to present multiple-choice questions with descriptions, gather multiple answers in one interaction, and proceed with confidence once clarified.

But Claude still defaults to assuming unless you tell it otherwise.

## Fix This in CLAUDE.md

Add explicit instructions to your project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Requirements Handling
- When in doubt, ask. Never make assumptions about unclear requirements.
- Ask clarifying questions before making architectural changes.
- If a requirement has multiple valid interpretations, present options before proceeding.
- Never assume technology choices, data models, or design patterns without confirmation.
```

This gives Claude explicit permission to ask questions. Without it, the default behavior is to guess.

## The 95% Certainty Technique

A powerful prompting approach: instruct Claude to ask questions until it reaches a confidence threshold.

```
Write a guide on setting up a home network.
Ask clarifying questions until you are 95% sure you can complete the task successfully.
```

This transforms one-directional interactions into collaborative conversations. The model must honestly gauge its comprehension before proceeding.

**Adjust the threshold based on task criticality:**
- 80% for brainstorming and exploration
- 95% for feature implementation
- 99% for production-critical changes

## Use Plan Mode to Force Questions

Plan mode (Shift+Tab twice) separates research from execution. This creates natural checkpoints for clarification.

Instead of assuming Claude knows what you want, explicitly prompt for questions:

```
Before you start planning the user authentication system,
ask me questions about the requirements.
I want to make sure we're building exactly what's needed.
```

Claude will ask things like:
- "Do you want social login options, or just email/password?"
- "Should we store user preferences locally or in the database?"
- "What's your plan for handling password resets?"

These questions often reveal assumptions you didn't realize you were making.

## Spec-Driven Development

For complex features, write requirements in a file before prompting Claude:

```markdown
<!-- requirements.md -->
## User Authentication Feature

### Must Have
- Email/password login
- Password reset via email
- Session expiry after 24 hours

### Must NOT Have
- Social login (out of scope)
- Two-factor authentication (phase 2)

### Open Questions
- Where should sessions be stored? (Redis vs database)
- Should we support "remember me" functionality?
```

Then tell Claude: "Read requirements.md. For any open questions, ask me before proceeding."

This approach:
- States explicit choices, removing guesswork
- Identifies deliberate exclusions
- Flags items needing your input

## Give Claude an Escape Hatch

In your CLAUDE.md, provide explicit guidance for uncertainty:

```markdown
## When Uncertain
If you are unsure about any requirement:
1. Ask a clarifying question, OR
2. Propose a short plan for review, OR
3. Present options with trade-offs

Never push large speculative changes without confirmation.
```

This tells Claude what to do instead of guessing. Without an alternative action, Claude defaults to proceeding with assumptions.

## Practical Examples

**Bad prompt:**
```
Add user authentication to the app
```

Claude assumes: OAuth vs JWT vs sessions, where to store tokens, middleware structure, password hashing algorithm, session duration, and more.

**Good prompt:**
```
Add user authentication to the app.

Before implementing, ask me about:
- Authentication method (OAuth, JWT, session-based)
- Password requirements and hashing
- Session storage and expiry
- What endpoints need protection

Don't write code until I've answered these questions.
```

**Bad prompt:**
```
Optimize the database queries
```

Claude assumes: which queries matter, what "optimized" means, acceptable trade-offs.

**Good prompt:**
```
Optimize the database queries.

First, identify the 3 slowest queries and ask me:
- Which ones actually matter for our use case?
- What query time is acceptable?
- Can we add indexes or change the schema?
```

## Recognize When Claude Is Assuming

Watch for these signals that Claude is making assumptions:

- Immediate implementation without questions
- Phrases like "I'll assume you want..." or "Assuming we're using..."
- Technology choices you didn't specify
- Edge case handling you didn't request
- Features beyond what you asked for

When you see these, interrupt with Escape and redirect: "Stop. I didn't specify that. What made you choose this approach? Ask me instead of assuming."

## The Long-Term Fix

For persistent improvement, add this to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Communication Style
- Treat unclear requirements as blockers, not opportunities to guess
- A wrong implementation costs more than a clarifying question
- When you notice yourself assuming, stop and ask instead
- List your assumptions explicitly before any implementation
```

Then reinforce with project-specific instructions as needed.

## The Bottom Line

Claude with assumptions is a fast typist making expensive guesses. Claude that asks questions is a thoughtful collaborator building what you actually need.

The fix is explicit: give Claude permission to ask, provide an escape hatch for uncertainty, and use plan mode to create natural checkpoints for clarification.

Every question asked saves an hour of rework. Every assumption caught prevents a feature rewrite. Make asking the default, not the exception.
