Your project's instruction manual for Claude. Put it at project root. This is the single most important file in your codebase for effective Claude Code usage - your agent's "constitution."

## The Framework: WHAT / WHY / HOW

Structure your CLAUDE.md around three dimensions:

- **WHAT**: Your tech stack, project structure, key files. Give Claude a map of the codebase. Critical in monorepos - identify apps, shared packages, and what everything is for.
- **WHY**: Purpose of components, architectural decisions. Help Claude understand intent, not just structure.
- **HOW**: Build commands, test procedures, verification steps. How Claude should actually work on the project. Use bun instead of node? Say so here.

## What to Document

### Essential

- **Build commands**: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`
- **Today's date**: So Claude researches current info, not outdated docs
- **Core files**: Key utilities, entry points, and their purposes
- **Code style**: Patterns to follow, patterns to avoid

### Important

- **Testing instructions**: Which tests to run, how to verify changes
- **Repository etiquette**: Branch naming, commit message style, merge vs rebase
- **Developer environment**: Required tools, versions, setup steps
- **Project quirks**: Unexpected behaviors, known issues, workarounds

### Critical Pitfalls to Prevent

- Using outdated library versions
- Adding unnecessary fallbacks or error handling
- Not thinking holistically (fixing one thing, breaking another)
- Not reading files before modifying them
- Creating new utilities when similar ones exist

## Critical Constraint: The 150-200 Rule

Research shows frontier LLMs follow ~150-200 instructions with reasonable consistency. Performance degrades as instruction count increases.

Claude Code's system prompt already has ~50 instructions. Your CLAUDE.md should contain as few instructions as possible - ideally only universally applicable ones.

**Key insight**: Claude receives a system reminder that CLAUDE.md content "may or may not be relevant to your task." The more non-universal content you include, the higher the chance Claude ignores your instructions entirely.

Keep it under 200 lines. Some teams keep their root file under 60 lines.

## Best Practices

### Make Instructions Stick

- **Use emphasis markers** for critical rules: "IMPORTANT", "YOU MUST", "NEVER", "ALWAYS"
- **Run through prompt improvers** - Anthropic teams do this to tune instruction-following
- **Test effectiveness** - A common mistake is adding extensive content without testing if Claude follows it

### Structure for Maintainability

- **Prefer pointers over copies**: Use `file:line` references instead of code snippets. Snippets become outdated quickly.
- **Provide alternatives**: "Use Y instead of X" works better than just "Never use X"
- **Start with guardrails, not manuals**: Document based on observed errors, not comprehensive coverage

### What NOT to Put Here

- **Linting rules**: Never send an LLM to do a linter's job. Use hooks instead (see Tip 40).
- **Task-specific guidance**: Database schema details distract when Claude works on unrelated tasks
- **Full documentation embeds**: Don't `@` mention extensive files. Instead, tell Claude when to read supplementary docs: "For advanced troubleshooting, see path/to/docs.md"

## Quick Setup

### Getting Started

```bash
# Auto-generate initial CLAUDE.md
/init
```

### Building Over Time

- Press `#` during sessions to add instructions you find yourself repeating
- These additions accumulate into a CLAUDE.md that reflects how you actually work
- Include updates in your commits for team benefit

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

For larger projects, create separate doc files instead of stuffing everything into CLAUDE.md:

```
agent_docs/
  |- building_the_project.md
  |- running_tests.md
  |- code_conventions.md
  |- service_architecture.md
```

Reference these from CLAUDE.md and instruct Claude to read relevant files for specific tasks.

## Placement Options

- `CLAUDE.md` at project root (shared with team)
- `CLAUDE.local.md` (personal, add to .gitignore)
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global, applies to all projects)
- `.claude/rules/` folder (modular rules in separate files)

See Tip 29 for hierarchical CLAUDE.md strategies across directories.

## Example Structure

```markdown
# Project Name

## Build Commands
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Production build
npm test         # Run tests

## Architecture
[Brief description of project structure]

## Key Patterns
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

## Rules
- IMPORTANT: Always [X] before [Y]
- NEVER [Z]
- For [complex task], read path/to/docs.md first
```
