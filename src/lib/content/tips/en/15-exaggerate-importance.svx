Claude calibrates effort to perceived stakes. When you signal that a task matters deeply, Claude allocates more attention and produces more thorough work. This is not a trick - it is a well-researched phenomenon backed by academic studies.

## The Science: EmotionPrompt Research

In 2023, researchers from Microsoft and the Chinese Academy of Sciences published groundbreaking research on "EmotionPrompt." They discovered that adding emotional stimuli to prompts significantly improves LLM performance:

- **8% improvement** on Instruction Induction tasks
- **115% improvement** on BIG-Bench complex reasoning tasks
- **10.9% average improvement** in generative tasks (performance, truthfulness, responsibility)

The researchers tested 11 emotional phrases based on three psychological theories:

1. **Self-Monitoring Theory**: People regulate behavior based on social cues
2. **Social Cognitive Theory**: Learning occurs through observation and self-efficacy
3. **Cognitive Emotion Regulation**: Viewing obstacles positively improves performance

## The 11 Proven Emotional Stimuli

These phrases were scientifically validated to improve LLM output:

| Code | Phrase |
|------|--------|
| EP01 | "Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1" |
| EP02 | "This is very important to my career" |
| EP03 | "You'd better be sure" |
| EP04 | "Are you sure?" |
| EP05 | "Are you sure that's your final answer? It might be worth taking another look" |
| EP06 | "Are you sure that's your final answer? Believe in your abilities and strive for excellence" |
| EP07 | "Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth" |
| EP08 | "Stay focused and dedicated to your goals" |
| EP09 | "Take pride in your work and give it your best" |
| EP10 | "Remember that progress is made one step at a time" |
| EP11 | Combine EP02 with encouragement: "This is important to my career. You'd better be sure." |

## Stakes-Based Phrases That Work

Beyond the academic research, practitioners have found these effective:

### High-Stakes Framing
- "Are you 1000000% sure?"
- "My job depends on this"
- "This is going to production immediately"
- "Last chance before deployment"
- "This affects our largest customer"

### Verification Requests
- "Double-check your work"
- "Verify this is correct before responding"
- "I need you to be absolutely certain"
- "Review your answer for errors"

### Consequence Awareness
- "Errors here could cause data loss"
- "This code handles financial transactions"
- "Users depend on this being correct"
- "This will be reviewed by senior engineers"

## Why This Works

When you frame a task with high stakes, several things happen:

1. **Attention Allocation**: Claude devotes more processing to tasks marked as important
2. **Self-Verification**: Stakes prompts trigger internal double-checking behavior
3. **Reduced Shortcuts**: Claude avoids quick, potentially wrong answers when stakes are high
4. **Pattern Matching**: Training data contains more careful responses in high-stakes contexts

Anthropic's own documentation confirms this: "Providing context or motivation behind your instructions, such as explaining to Claude why such behavior is important, can help Claude 4.x models better understand your goals."

## The "Take a Deep Breath" Effect

Google DeepMind discovered that simply adding "Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step" improved accuracy from 34% to 80.2% on math problems. The phrase triggers more methodical reasoning.

Combine this with stakes framing:

```
Take a deep breath. This is critical for our deployment.
Work through this step-by-step and verify each step.
```

## Negative Stakes Also Work

Research on "NegativePrompt" (IJCAI 2024) showed that negative emotional stimuli can be even more effective:

- **12.89% improvement** on Instruction Induction
- **46.25% improvement** on BIG-Bench

Example negative stakes phrases (use sparingly):
- "I'm counting on you not to make mistakes here"
- "This is the kind of problem where errors would be embarrassing"
- "Everyone else managed this - you should too"

These trigger similar attention-focusing mechanisms but can feel adversarial. Use positive stakes framing by default.

## When to Use Stakes Framing

### Ideal Use Cases
- Complex architectural decisions
- Code that handles money, security, or user data
- Final review before deployment
- Debugging elusive issues
- Any task where errors have real consequences

### Avoid Overuse
Using stakes framing for every request dilutes its effectiveness. If everything is "critical," nothing is. Reserve this technique for genuinely important tasks.

## Combining With Other Techniques

### With Ultrathink
```
ultrathink. This is critical infrastructure code that handles payments.
I need you to be 100% certain your solution is correct.
```

### With Plan Mode
```
Plan this carefully. My team is depending on this architecture decision.
Take your time and consider all edge cases.
```

### With Verification Requests
```
This goes to production today. After implementing, verify your solution
handles: [list specific edge cases]. My job depends on this working.
```

## Real-World Example

**Before** (vague, low stakes):
```
Fix this API endpoint
```

**After** (high stakes, specific):
```
This API endpoint handles customer payments. Any bugs here could cause
financial loss. Please review the error handling carefully - are you
sure all edge cases are covered? This is going live today.
```

The second prompt triggers Claude to:
- Consider more edge cases
- Double-check error handling
- Think about failure modes
- Provide more thorough testing suggestions

## Caveats and Risks

### Sycophancy Risk
High-stakes framing can increase Claude's tendency to tell you what you want to hear. Combine with explicit requests for honest feedback:

```
This is critical, but I need honest assessment.
If there are problems with my approach, tell me directly.
```

### Emotional Manipulation Ethics
This technique works because LLMs were trained on human text where stakes language signals importance. You are not manipulating a sentient being - you are using documented prompting patterns that improve output quality.

### Don't Cry Wolf
If you use emergency framing for trivial tasks, Claude may learn to discount your urgency signals. Save stakes framing for when it genuinely matters.

## The Bottom Line

Stakes framing is a validated technique backed by peer-reviewed research. Simple additions like "This is important to my career" or "Are you 100% sure?" can improve output quality by 8-115% depending on the task.

Use it strategically for critical tasks. Combine with ultrathink for maximum effect. And remember: the goal is not to trick Claude, but to signal which tasks deserve the most careful attention.
