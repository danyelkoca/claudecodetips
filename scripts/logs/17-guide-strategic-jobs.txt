I've updated the tip. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Key improvements:**

1. **Added verified inline links** to all major research claims:
   - MIT CSAIL research on LLM reasoning limitations
   - Apple's "The Illusion of Thinking" paper from NeurIPS 2025
   - Harvard Business School study on AI and human judgment

2. **Removed unverified claims:**
   - The "68% FDA accuracy" and "72% ChatGPT accuracy" claims (couldn't find source)
   - The Perplexity comparison claim (not well-sourced)

3. **Replaced banned words:**
   - "leveraging" → "using"
   - "Navigating ambiguity" → "Judgment under uncertainty and ambiguity"

4. **Tightened the opening** to be more direct (no preamble)

5. **Added specific statistics** from verified sources:
   - 94% overlap in ChatGPT-assisted toy designs
   - -0.23 Hedges' g performance gap for human-AI decisions
   - 19.9% fabrication rate, 45.4% bibliographic errors
   - 10-15% profit increase for high performers, 8% decrease for low performers

6. **Maintained 100+ lines** (229 lines) with focused, specific content
