I've updated tip 08 with the following changes:

**Factual corrections:**
- Fixed the Opus Plan Mode section: changed "Select option 4" to the correct `/model opusplan` command
- Corrected the claim about `~/.claude/plans/`: plans stored there aren't automatically loaded in new sessions. Added accurate guidance on persisting plans via `.claude/PLAN.md` with explicit import
- Added verified links to [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config) and [settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)
- Fixed settings.json structure (confirmed `permissions.defaultMode` is correct)

**Overlap reductions:**
- Trimmed the plan iteration content (overlapped with Tip 9: Never Accept Generic Plans)
- Shortened extended thinking section (Tip 12 covers ultrathink in depth)
- Removed "brainstorming" use case (generic)
- Removed "speed-critical work" skip reason (not plan mode specific)

**Voice improvements:**
- Removed banned heading "Why This Changes Everything"
- Fixed contractions throughout (it's, can't, aren't, don't)
- Removed passive constructions
- Added first-person practitioner perspective where appropriate
- Stronger opening that states the point directly
- More concrete examples with specific file paths

**Line count:** 159 lines (meets 100+ requirement)
