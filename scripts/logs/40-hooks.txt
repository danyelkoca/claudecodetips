The tip has been updated. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Corrections made:**
1. **Fixed incorrect environment variable** - Changed `CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH` to `CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS` (the actual documented variable)
2. **Fixed non-existent flag** - Replaced `claude --no-hooks` with the correct method: `--settings no-hooks.json` with `{"disableAllHooks": true}`
3. **Added stdin JSON parsing** - Hooks receive input via stdin, not just env vars. Added `jq` parsing examples throughout
4. **Added reliability warning** - Noted that some environment variables have had reliability issues; recommend parsing stdin
5. **Removed banned word** - Replaced "Critical" with clearer wording

**Improvements:**
- Stronger practitioner-focused opener with personal experience
- Added [inline link](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) to official documentation
- Added warning about Stop hook infinite loops
- Added `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` usage example for SessionStart
- Added sixth pitfall about JSON parsing
- More detailed debug output example
- All code examples now show proper stdin JSON parsing

**Verified facts:**
- 10 hook events: confirmed against official docs
- Exit code 2 behavior: confirmed
- v2.0.10+ for `updatedInput` feature: confirmed
- 60-second default timeout: confirmed
- Configuration precedence: confirmed
- Notification matchers: confirmed
