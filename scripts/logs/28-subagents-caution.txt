The tip has been updated. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Verified claims with inline links:**
- Added link to [Claude Code's built-in subagents documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)
- Added link to [Haiku 4.5 announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5) with corrected speed/cost comparison (2-4x faster, one-third the cost)
- Added link to [Factory.ai's research on context compression](https://factory.ai/news/evaluating-compression) for the 2.19-2.45/5.0 artifact tracking claim
- Added link to [Anthropic's multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system) with updated quote about external storage

**Fixed inaccuracies:**
- Changed "4-5x faster and ~80% cheaper" to "2-4x faster at about one-third the cost" (verified from Anthropic's announcement)

**Style improvements:**

- Tightened the opener to be more direct
- Condensed the "Master-Clone Pattern" section into "Let the Main Agent Decide" to reduce overlap with Tip 31
