Updated the tip successfully. Here's a summary of changes made:

**Factual corrections:**

- Updated pre-commit-hooks version from v4.5.0 to v6.0.0
- Clarified git reflog retention: 90 days for reachable commits, 30 days for unreachable

**Added with verification:**
- [/rewind checkpointing](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing) explanation with limitations vs git
- [Anthropic's best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) citation for 90% git usage claim
- [Veracode's 2025 research](https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/) link for 45% security flaw statistic
- [git add -p interactive staging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging) documentation
- [reflog tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-reflog) reference
- [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) link
