The tip has been updated. Here's a summary of the changes made:

**Factual corrections:**
- Removed unverifiable "16% hallucination rate" claim (no source found)
- Removed outdated Claude 2.1 "27% middle-positioned accuracy" claim (this was a quirk specific to that model, fixed by prompting)
- Updated auto-compaction trigger from "~80%" to "~95%" based on current documentation
- Updated startup token consumption from "~20k baseline" to "30-60k with MCP tools" based on verified reports

**Added inline sources:**
- [Stanford's "Lost in the Middle" research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) for U-shaped attention patterns
- [MIT 2025 research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01951) for causal masking causing position bias

**Removed overlapping content:**
- "The Science Behind Context Degradation" section (overlaps with Tip 19: Quality Degrades in Long Sessions)
- "Parallel Isolated Sessions" with git worktrees (overlaps with Tip 27: Git Worktrees)

**Updated memory system details:**
- Added CLAUDE.local.md (personal project preferences)
- Added ./.claude/rules/*.md (modular rule files)
- Added ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (user-level)
- Added @path/to/file import syntax

**Added new practical content:**
- The /catchup pattern as a workflow alternative
- MCP tool definitions as a context consumer in /context output
- Internal todo list explicitly listed as wiped on /clear

Final tip is 158 lines (exceeds 100+ requirement).
