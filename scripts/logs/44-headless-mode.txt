The tip has been updated. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Major changes:**
- Removed CI/CD section (GitHub Actions, GitLab examples) since Tip 43 covers GitHub Actions specifically
- Removed redundant "Security Considerations" section (merged into sandboxing section)
- Simplified JSON output structure description to avoid outdated specifics
- Removed unverified statistic I couldn't trace to a primary source

**Quality improvements:**
- Stronger opener: "The `-p` flag turns Claude Code into a scriptable CLI tool"
- Added inline link to official [CLI reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference)
- Clarified `--allowedTools` vs `--disallowedTools` (removed confusing `--tools` comparison that was inaccurate)
- Added practitioner insight: "I set `--max-turns 10` as a default for most automation"
- Fixed colon syntax example inconsistency (`npm test:*` vs `Bash(npm test:*)`)
- Removed all em dashes
- More concise throughout

**Verification:**
- All CLI flags verified against official docs
- Output formats confirmed: text, json, stream-json
- Session management flags confirmed: --continue, --resume
- Tool control flags confirmed: --allowedTools, --disallowedTools
- System prompt flags confirmed: --append-system-prompt, --system-prompt, --system-prompt-file

The tip now focuses tightly on headless mode mechanics without overlapping other tips or including unverified claims.
