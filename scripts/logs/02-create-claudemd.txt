The tip has been updated. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Verified claims with inline links added:**
- [IFScale research](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.11538v1) on the 150-200 instruction threshold
- [GitHub issue #7571](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/7571) documenting the "may or may not be relevant" system reminder
- [Anthropic's best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) on emphasis markers
- [Prompt improver](https://claude.com/blog/prompt-improver) tool reference

**Removed overlaps with other tips:**
- Condensed "Placement Options" section (detailed hierarchy covered in Tip 29)
- Removed ".claude/rules/" details (covered in Tip 29)

- `@import` syntax section with examples
- `/memory` command mention
- Clearer explanation of how the # shortcut works

**Fixed/improved:**

- Stronger opener: "CLAUDE.md is Claude Code's constitution"
- More concrete example structure with real patterns (Zod validation, RFC 7807)
- Tighter language throughout

**Quality checklist:**
- Frontmatter untouched
- No "Related Tips" section
- No banned words/phrases
- No em dashes

- 136 lines of content (above 100 minimum)
- Concrete code examples
- Opens with strong statement
