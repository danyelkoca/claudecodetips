The tip is complete. Here's what I changed:

**Verified and linked sources:**
- Added [Anthropic's own documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices#overeagerness-and-file-creation) confirming Opus 4.5's over-engineering tendency
- Added [Ox Security's "Army of Juniors" research](https://www.ox.security/resource-category/whitepapers-and-reports/army-of-juniors/) with specific anti-pattern percentages
- Added [GitClear's 211M lines study](https://www.gitclear.com/ai_assistant_code_quality_2025_research) with specific metrics
- Added [Kin Lane quote](https://kinlane.com/about/) with attribution
- Added [Ana Bildea's 18-month observation](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/11/ai-code-technical-debt/) from InfoQ
- Added [Martin Fowler's YAGNI principle](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) with the four costs
- Added [Helicone comparison](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/claude-opus-and-sonnet-4-full-developer-guide) for Opus vs Sonnet

**Removed overlaps:**
- Removed "Use Plan Mode" section (covered in Tip 8)

**Updated for current models:**
- Changed outdated "Claude 4 and Opus 4.5" to current model names

**Tightened structure:**
- Stronger opener referencing Anthropic's official docs
- Renamed sections for clarity ("The Surgical Coding Prompt" to "Force Codebase Alignment")
- Removed redundant "This prompt does three things" numbered list
- More direct language throughout

**Line count:** 128 lines (exceeds 100+ requirement)
