**Key improvements:**

1. **Strong opening** - Replaced table-only format with a direct statement: "These shortcuts live in muscle memory after a week."

2. **Added missing shortcuts:**
   - `Ctrl+G` - Open prompt in system text editor
   - `Alt+M` - Alternative to Shift+Tab for mode switching
   - `Ctrl+J` - Line feed for multiline input
   - `Tab` for thinking toggle (with note about version differences)
   - Windows `Alt+V` for image paste

3. **Added missing commands:**
   - `/ide` - Manage IDE integrations
   - `/plugin` - Manage plugins
   - `/usage` - Plan limits and rate limits
   - `/stats` - Usage analytics
   - `/statusline`, `/theme`, `/output-style`, `/vim`
   - `/privacy-settings`, `/release-notes`
   - `/todos` - Track TODO items

4. **Added practitioner insights:**
   - "Ctrl+O is gold for debugging"
   - Tmux users need double Ctrl+B
   - Rewind resets messages only, not files
   - Model switching mid-prompt use case

5. **Added inline links** to official documentation (all verified):
   - Rewind menu, verbose output, terminal setup, context visualization, security review, MCP

6. **Removed overlaps:**
   - Removed "See Tip #30 for details" reference
   - Kept custom commands section brief since Tip #30 covers it in depth

7. **Updated information:**
   - Added terminals supported by /terminal-setup (Kitty, Alacritty, Zed, Warp)
   - Added subdirectory namespace syntax for custom commands
   - Noted Tab toggle may require /config on some versions (recent bugs)

8. **180 lines** - Well above the 100-line minimum
