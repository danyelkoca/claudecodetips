I've updated the tip. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed incorrect agent reference**: Changed "Built-in agents (Explore, Plan, Verify)" to "Built-in agents (general-purpose, Explore, Plan)" since "Verify" doesn't exist as a built-in agent.

2. **Updated token count**: Changed "~100 tokens per Skill" to "30-50 tokens per Skill" based on official documentation.

3. **Added inline documentation links**:
   - Progressive disclosure best practices
   - Official Skills docs
   - GitHub anthropics/skills repository
   - Slash commands docs for character budget info

4. **Enhanced debugging section** with practical issues discovered from real GitHub issues:
   - Prettier reformatting multi-line YAML
   - Character budget limit (15,000 chars default)
   - `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` workaround
   - Checking `/context` for "M of N commands" warnings
   - Script permissions (`chmod +x`)

5. **Updated model name**: Changed `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` to `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` (current format).

6. **Clarified subagent behavior**: Added note that subagents don't inherit Skills from parent conversation.

7. **Minor improvements**:
   - Removed redundant info (scripts explanation was duplicated)
   - Tightened wording throughout
   - Added practical tip about manually copying skill folders
