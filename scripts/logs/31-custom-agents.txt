The tip has been updated. Here's what I changed:

**Verified and corrected factual claims:**
- Fixed model pricing: The original tip had inaccurate speed claims ("27s", "86s", "76s") and cost claims ("5x Sonnet"). Updated with [verified pricing from Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5): Haiku $1/$5, Sonnet $3/$15, Opus $5/$25 per million tokens
- Added the complete tools list including `Task`, `BashOutput`, `KillShell`
- Added MCP tool inheritance behavior
- Updated `--debug` flag to show it accepts category filters

**Added missing features:**
- `--agents` CLI flag for dynamic agent definition
- Details on how `/agents` command works
- Priority order: Project > CLI > User level agents

**Removed overlaps with Tip 28 (Subagents - Use with Caution):**
- Removed the "Context Isolation Benefits" section (covered extensively in Tip 28)
- Removed general subagent architecture discussion (Tip 28's focus)
- Kept this tip focused on **creating and configuring** custom agents

**Improved structure:**
- Stronger opener that explains what agents are in one sentence
- Consolidated 4 example agents into 3 focused examples with clear purposes
- Added "Writing Good Agent Prompts" section with actionable patterns
- Added "Single Responsibility Principle" to prevent bloated agents
- Rewrote model selection with practitioner perspective

**Cleaned up style:**
- Removed em dashes
- No banned words remain
- Direct, specific language throughout
- Added inline links to [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) and [Anthropic's Haiku announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5)

Final tip: 277 lines (well above the 100-line minimum)
