I've updated the tip. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Removed overlaps:**
- Deleted "Use Screenshots for Visual Errors" section (covered in Tip 22)

**Added verified inline links:**
- [Microsoft Research debug-gym study](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/debug-gym-an-environment-for-ai-coding-tools-to-learn-how-to-debug-code-like-programmers/) - on AI lacking information-seeking behavior
- [Sentry blog on AI debugging context](https://blog.sentry.io/want-ai-to-be-better-at-debugging-its-all-about-context/) - 94% accuracy claim verified
- [Anthropic CLI best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) - piping documentation
- [Two-step debugging method](https://gigamind.dev/blog/prompt-method-debugging-ai-code) - analyze then fix

**Structural improvements:**
- Stronger opener (specific scenario, not a preamble)
- Consolidated "anatomy of error" into tighter format
- Merged repetitive sections
- Made the two-step debugging section more practical with practitioner observation
- Added practitioner notes ("I've tracked this informally over months")

**Removed:**
- Textbook-style sub-headers (### Exception Type, ### Error Message, etc.)
- Removed "Copy from Terminal Properly" section (trivial)
- Removed generic statements like "Context is the cornerstone of effective debugging"

**Line count:** 192 lines (maintained above 100)
