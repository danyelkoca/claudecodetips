- Link to the [GitHub Action for automated PR security reviews](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review)
- Real performance data from [Semgrep's security research](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/finding-vulnerabilities-in-modern-web-apps-using-claude-code-and-openai-codex/): 14% true positive rate, 86% false positives, with breakdown by vulnerability type
- Honest limitations about multi-file taint tracking
- Advice to pair with traditional SAST tools (Semgrep, SonarQube)
- Practitioner insights throughout sections (i18n costs, dead code verification caveats, test audit limitations)
