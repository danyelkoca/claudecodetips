Done. Here's what I changed:

**Removed/Fixed:**
- Removed unverified "40% of time on repetitive tasks" claim (couldn't find reliable source)
- Removed "Workflow Integration" section (it was essentially a "Related Tips" section)
- Removed generic "What is Boilerplate?" textbook definition
- Removed excessive category lists (condensed into prose)
- Fixed "30-60% time savings" claim by adding nuance from METR study showing AI can actually slow down complex tasks

**Added:**
- Strong practitioner-focused opening
- [Veracode 2025 study link](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/08/07/create-ai-code-security-risks/) for the 45% security vulnerability claim (verified)
- [METR study link](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) showing experienced devs were 19% slower with AI on complex tasks
- [JetBrains 2025 survey link](https://blog.jetbrains.com/research/2025/10/state-of-developer-ecosystem-2025/) confirming boilerplate as top AI use case
- Real practitioner example at the end
- Nuanced take on when boilerplate generation works vs. doesn't

**Quality checks passed:**
- 142 lines (above 100 minimum)
- No banned words/phrases
- No em dashes
- No "Related Tips" section
- All URLs fetched and verified
- Frontmatter untouched
- No overlaps with other tips
